Omni-parser -> LLM (given task and omni-parsers buttons)  -> puppeteer / Playwright -> repeat
Use groq
Structuured output lmstudio and llama-cpp-agent with llama-cpp-python
Just use claUDE if we can get it to run with Haiku
Goal "Look up weather in London" get output as json


Temporary TODO:

- Kavelogics: Google maps -> Hunter -> Generate Leads
- Fellowship: Get Omniparser up and running.
- IoT Project: Learn DeepStream SDK
- Research Assistant: Follow-up on Monday

Therefore:
- First get google maps api, then attach hunter, then try to generate leads, and get some data.
- After that, install omniparser, and try to get it running.
- In free time, learn something.

Learning Priority:
- Backend:Python -> Django + ML/AI
- LLMs: RNNs -> Transformers -> Attention blocks -> Word embeddings -> LLama3.1

Priority:
- Focus on Python stack (Django + AI/ML)

Plan:
So the plan is this. Since, right now I have leg stuck in LLMs, web scraping, marketing automation, and computer vision at embedded systems, what is the common thing? Python. I am learning what? Python itself, lead generation, automation, llm, nvidia deepstream, computer vision etc. What can I do with it to earn? I can start to sell the knowledge that I gain from this under my upwork profile. What type of jobs I can do? Python scripting, ML/AI (computer vision + llms etc). What does this fall under? ML/AI services. Then I will shift to django and learn that shit. Then I will create a second upwork specialization called: Backend (Python/Django).

How much money is expected?
This month I will earn 10k. Thats it. But next month, I will ask this mofo to give me 80k (the lowest I will agree on is 60k). I am expecting to close a small client (~100$ ~25k PKR) on Upwork within 2 weeks. So by the end of next month, I will have 100k. Then I will try to close more clients on Upwork, and hopefully score bigger clients. My target is to make 200k within 6 months. QUITE FCKING POSSIBLE.
