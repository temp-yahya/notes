## Body Language
### Genuine Smile
Do not flash an immediate smile when you greet someone, as though anyone who walked into your line of sight would be the beneficiary. Instead, look at the other person's face for a second, pause, and soak in their persona.

Then let a big, warm, responsive smile flood over your face and overflow into your eyes. It will engulf the recipient like a warm wave. The split-second delay convinces people that your smile is genuine and only for them.

If you flash everyone the same smile, it loses value. When meeting a group of people, grace each one with a distinct smile. If one person in a group is more important to you than the others, reserve an especially big smile just for him.

### Eye Contact for Conversation
Pretend your eyes are glued to your conversation partner's eyes. Do not break eye contact even after he or she has finished speaking. When you must look away, do it ever so slowly and reluctantly.

Exaggerated eye contact can be extremely advantageous, especially between the sexes, even when romance is not involved. Maintaining strong eye contact awakens a feeling of respect and affection, and creates an impression of being an intelligent and abstract thinker. 

However, in a man-to-man conversation, long eye contacts make men feel threatened or your intentions can get misinterpreted. So make eye contact a little less intense when discussing personal matters with other men. It creates a feeling of comprehension and respect.

### Eye contact for Expressing Interest
This technique takes at least three people to pull off - you, your target, and one other person. Watch your target person even when someone else is talking. Your target senses that you are extremely interested in his or her reactions. 

But because it puts you in a position of judging someone else, you must not overdo it. So instead watch the speaker but let your glance bounce to your target each time the speaker finishes a point. This lets your target know that you are interested in their reaction.

### Posture of a Winner
Winners stand with assurance, move with confidence, and smile softly with pride. A good posture symbolizes that you are someone who is used to being on top.

Visualize a circus iron-jaw bit hanging from the frame of every door you walk through. Take a bite and, with it firmly between your teeth, let it swoop you to the peek of the big top. When you hang by your teeth, every muscle is stretched into perfect posture position.

### Enthusiasm in Greeting
When you meet someone, greet them like you would if a cute tiny baby crawled up to your feet. Give the warm smile, the total-body turn, and the undivided attention. Pivoting towards a new person very strongly suggests that you think they are very, very special.

Another trick is to imagine that the person is an old friend. This tricks your mind and body to fill up with warmth and enthusiasm. When the shyness and hostility fades away, stop pretending and speak with the appropriate words and tone.

### Appear Credible
When you want to appear credible in a conversation, do not fidget. Do not fidget even if your nose itch, ear tingle, or your foot prickle. Do not fidget, twitch, squirm, or scratch. Such hand motions and fidgeting can give your listener the gut feeling that you are lying.

### Appear Intelligent
Make it a habit to get on dual track while talking. Express yourself, but keep a keen eye on how your listener is reacting to what you are saying. Then plan your moves accordingly. People will say you pick on everything, and never miss a trick.

### Practice by Visualizing
Rehearse these body language techniques ahead of time. Visualize yourself walking around with good posture, smiling warmly, and making great eye contact.  After you visualize yourself a few times, it all happens automatically.

## Small Talk
### Match Their Mood
Before opening your mouth, take a voice sample of your listener to detect his or her state of mind. If you ever want to bring people around to your thoughts, you must match their mood and voice tone, if only for a moment.

### Good Opening Line
Anything can be a good opening line, because 80 percent of your listener's impression has nothing to do with your words anyways. Almost anything you say at first is fine. An empathetic mood, a positive demeanor, and passionate delivery make you sound exciting.

Anything you say is fine as long as it is not complaining, rude, or unpleasant. If your first words out of your mouth are a complaint, people label you a complainer. Because that complaint is your acquaintance's total sampling of you so far.

Another technique that is rarely used except for politicians is to simply ask the person about another interesting person, or make the introduction or pump for a few facts that you can immediately turn into icebreakers.

### Make People Approach You
Whenever you go to a gathering, wear or carry something unusual to give people who find you the delightful stranger across the crowded room an excuse to approach you.

### Infiltrate into a Group
Just stand behind the group of people you want to infiltrate and open your ears. Wait for any tiny flimsy excuse and jump in with: "Excuse me, I could not help but overhear blah blah". This will be awkward momentarily, but you will be in the conversation from there on.

### Respond to "So Where Are You From"
Whenever someone asks you the inevitable: "So where are you from?", never respond with a one-word answer. Learn some engaging facts about your hometown that the conversation partner can comment on. Then when they say something clever in response, they will think that you are a great conversationalist.

### Respond to "What Do You Do"
Whenever someone asks you the inevitable: "So what do you do?", never respond with the boring: "I am an engineer/doctor/economist". Instead, let a different true story about your professional life roll off your tongue for each listener.

Ask yourself: "What possible interest could this person have in my answer? Could he refer business to me? Buy from me? Hire me? Marry my sister? Become my buddy?"

### Introducing People
When introducing people, do not make a brief introduction, and stand their with a fake, idiotic smile. Instead, bait the conversation with some hook, that will get their conversation going. Once they are comfortable talking, you are free to stay or leave.

### Rescue a Dying Conversation
Listen to your conversation partner's every word for clues to his preferred topics. The evidence is bound to slip out. Then when you feel that the conversation is dying out, ignite the conversation by talking about the subject that the other person finds interesting.

### Make the Other Person Like You
The more you let the other person speak about themselves, the more they will like you. Let the other person speak as much as they want, and show them that you find these facts about them interesting.

### What to Say Next
Never be speechless again. Like a parrot, simply repeat the last few words your conversation partner says. That puts the ball right back in his court, and then all you need to do is listen.

### Get Them Happily Chatting
The sweetest sound a performer can hear from the audience is: "Encore! Lets hear it again!". Similarly, the sweetest sound your conversation partner can hear when you are talking with a group of people is: "Tell them about the time you blah blah".

Whenever you are at a meeting or party with someone important to you, think of some stories he told you. Choose an appropriate one from their repertoire that the crowd will enjoy. Then shine the spotlight by requesting a repeat performance.

### Come Across as a Positive Person
When first meeting someone, do not start sharing a dirty secret, reveal an intimacy, or make a confession. Since the instinctive reaction is: "What else is coming? If he shares that with me so quickly, what else is he hiding?" So stick with positive talks in the start.

### Always Have Something Interesting to Say
Before leaving for a party, turn on the radio or read the newspaper. Anything that happened today is good material for a conversation. Knowing the big news of the moment is also a defensive move that rescues you from asking what everybody is talking about.

### Better Way to Know What They Do
By asking: "What do you do?", you might get labelled as a ruthless networker, a social climber, or a gold-digging wife. A better way is to ask: "How do you spend most of your time?"

### Sound Intelligent
Look up some common words you use every day in the thesaurus. If you like the new words, start making permanent replacements. Remember that only fifty words makes the difference between a rich vocabulary and an average one.

### How to Not Sound Anxious
Whenever you have something in common with someone, the longer you wait to reveal it, the more moved and impressed he will be. You will seem like a confident big cat, not a lonely one looking for quick connection with a stranger. However, do not wait too long either.

### Gain Their Affection
Start every appropriate sentence with "you". It immediately grabs your listener's attention. It gets a more positive response because it pushes the pride button and saves them having to translate it into "me" terms.

### Avoid Sounding Like a Jerk
Do not use cliches when chatting with big winners. Instead, roll your own clever phrases. To do that, you can read speaker's books and learn quotations. Then make them rhyme and funny.
