There is a science to persuasion. Specifically, there are six weapons of influence which people and companies (especially advertisers) use to try and get you to do something or buy their stuff. Those weapons of influence are:

**Reciprocity**: You always feel an obligation to give back when you have received something first. Be the first to give something personalized and unexpected to the person you are trying to influence and they will feel obligated to do the same for you.

**Consistency**: People prefer to take action which is consistent with what they have previously said or done. Therefore, look for small initial commitments they are willing to make and they will then be more likely to agree to much bigger commitments in the future.

**Social Proof**: People always look to the actions and behaviors of others for hints on how they should act in any setting. If you point out the choice that many others in comparable situations have made, you increase the pressure for them to do the same.

**Likability**: People prefer to say "yes" to those they like. Always look for areas of agreeability or similarity before you start getting into more controversial topics. Give sincere compliments first and you enhance your persuasiveness.

**Authority**: People inherently like to follow the lead of credible experts. Signal your credentials and your power to influence will increase accordingly. Have your team members introduce you as an expert and customers will be inclined to follow along without question.

**Scarcity**: People always want more of what there is less of. To increase demand for your products and services, point out what is unique about them and then explain why stock is limited. Explain what people stand to lose if they fail to buy to ratchet up the pressure to buy.

These weapons of influence work because life is busy and you need to make quick decisions rather than laboriously gather all the data. Therefore, you rely on such isolated pieces of information to decide quickly.

To counter these weapons of influence, be aware of what the compliance professionals are trying to do. They are selectively fudging the data to try and get you to say "yes" to whatever they offer. Fight back and retaliate.

## Reciprocity
Reciprocation is when someone gives something, there is an innate obligation to give back. The rule of reciprocity often produces a "yes" response to a request that, except for an existing feeling of indebtedness, would have surely been refused.

This principle is evidenced in various social science experiments, notably in marketing. Free samples are used extensively and successfully to influence people to buy. Once customers accepted the free sample, it is very hard for them to then walk away empty handed.

The conventional approach of most businesses is to first try and sell an entry level product which requires a small investment and then encourage people to trade-up to the higher end products if they require more functionality.

The rejection-then-retreat technique goes in the opposite direction. You offer your top of the line product first and make a serious attempt to sell that. If they say "no", you then offer a low-end product which will seem very cheap by comparison. This works because:

- It changes the buyer's perceptions in your favor. A high-end initial request will make your second request seem much smaller and easier to agree to.
- By making your biggest and best offer first, you really can not lose. Your fallback offer is still a good outcome if they agree. Either way, you have made a sale.
- By starting with an extreme demand and then retreating to a more moderate demand, you have clearly made a concession. The other person therefore feels obligated to make a concession themselves and agree to that more moderate demand.

To disarm the rejection-then-retreat tactic, openly acknowledge it. Right from the start, tell the other person that you are happy to accept the gift but will not feel any obligation to buy. This upfront approach alleviates pressure to reciprocate solely based on prior concessions.

## Consistency
Consistency is deeply ingrained into the way most people have been taught to live their lives, by having been told statements like: "If you commit to something, make sure you follow through and do it. Be true to your word".

Toy manufacturers exploit the power of consistency as a driver of human action. Prior to Christmas holidays, they run attractive TV ads to lure kids. The kids beg their parents to buy them those toys, and parents make the promise.

However, the toy companies deliberately under supply the stores with the advertised toys, and instead, over supply substitute toys of equal value. The parents have to buy these substitute toys, so they do not disappoint their kids.

Right after the Christmas, the toy manufacturers start running the ads again for the original special toys, and this time, they adequately supply the stores. The kids reminds their parents of their original promise, so the parents have to buy those special toys as well.

The drivers of commitment can be quite subtle. If a charity solicitor calls you, asking: "How are you doing?", and you superficially responds with: "Doing good thanks", then it will be much harder for you to later turn down their request to help those who are not doing as good as you.

Salesperson know that the best way to build momentum for a large scale is to make a small sale first. This is termed: "the foot-in-the-door technique". Even just getting the customer to fill an order form by hand can increase their sense of commitment to move forward.

A common tactic in the car retailing industry is called "throwing a lowball". A salesperson offers a car at a lower price than everyone else. After you fill out the paperwork, the salesperson will apologize that their boss did not approve or they forgot to add in some cost.

A large number of people will still go ahead with the deal at a higher price because they want to be aligned with their previous decision.

The best way to avoid lowballing and any other consistency driven behavior is to keep asking yourself: "Knowing what I know now, if I could go back in time, would I still make the same choice?" If the answer is no, do not feel bad for changing your mind and ask for a better deal.

## Social Proof
The more people you see doing something, the more you will assume that is the right course of action. That is why television shows have canned laughter, advertisers love to inform us about best sellers, and bartenders salt their tip jars with a few dollar bills.

In 1820s, two French opera fans leased themselves to opera managers who wanted to be assured of appreciative audience. They would attend performances and applause wildly. They would even weep at sensitive moments. This incited others to do the same as well.

Numerous studies have shown that the most influential social proof comes from ordinary people who we can all relate to. If you see something that someone in a comparable position to yourself has done, you are likely to take more notice than if they were a celebrity.

In many ways, people use social proof as a shortcut for doing their own thinking. However, if you get any suspicion that the presented evidence has been manipulated, the social proof can backfire, and make you indignant about doing what is being promoted.

Keep in mind that social proof should not be trusted fully. Whenever you feel influenced by social proof, see whether it aligns with objective facts, your prior experiences, and your own judgement.

Also remind yourself that influencers will generally only let you hear from those who like their product or service. Your need to look at the full picture, and consider the dissenting voices too.

## Likability
It sounds entirely logical that we prefer to say "yes" to the requests of people we know and like. That is why charities recruit local volunteers to go out and ask for donations close to their own homes. It is much harder to say "no" to a friend that some faceless charity.

A striking aspect of likability is that the person does not even need to be present for their influence to be evident. Salesperson inform new prospects that their friend has suggested to call them. Now rejecting the salesperson feels like rejecting the friend as well.

Likability can be a driving factor that makes prospects decide to do business with you rather than anyone else. Social scientists have concluded that likability is usually driven by:

- **Physical attractiveness**: You are more likely to like someone who is good looking.
- **Similarity or familiarity**: You will feel more inclined to agree with someone who has the same beliefs as you or who you know personally.
- **Compliments**: You will be more open to someone who says good things about you.
- **Association**: You will feel more positive towards a person who was part of your success and more negative towards someone who was involved in some disaster of your life.

When all of these factors combine, the net cumulative result of likability can be a significant boost in your power of influence. The interesting thing is that small actions count. Not everything has to be a grand gesture that captivates the headlines.

To counteract the influence of likability, mentally separate the person from the product or service. Concentrate on the metrics of the product rather than the fondness for the person doing the pitching, and make a decision based on just facts.

## Authority
Whether you notice or not, you have been trained almost from birth to follow instructions from those in authority. As a result, most people consider information from a recognized authority to be a valuable shortcut on how to act in those situations.

Physicians who possess large amounts of knowledge and experience are highly respected authorities on health matters. Health care staff therefore are inclined to obey doctor's orders even when it is clear that an obvious error has been made.

There are in general three symbols of authority in modern society:

- **Titles**: Titles like doctors or professors confer instant status on people and can strongly influence how others act around them.
- **Clothes**: Clothes like police uniforms, priest's robes, or nurse scrubs causes people to associate them with authority.
- **Trappings**: Finely styled and expensive clothes, expensive jewelry, and prestige cars creates an illusion that the person is powerful and has authority.

The best tactic for guarding against undue influence from the use of authority as a weapon is to remove its element of surprise from the start. Always ask these questions:

- **Is this authority truly an expert in this field?** Look at the evidence and you will often find their credentials solely built on empty titles rather than training or knowledge.
- **How truthful can we expect the expert to be here?** Figure out whether have a hidden agenda or incentive to say something.

## Scarcity
Human instinctively want more of whatever is in short supply. The idea of potential loss plays a large role in decision making. People seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the thought of gaining something of equal value.

A salesperson, for example, approaches a couple who had paused in front of an appliance and states: "Nice, I see you are interested in this model. I can understand why; it is a great machine and at a great price. Unfortunately, I just sold this appliance to another couple a few minutes ago. And if I am not mistaken, that was the last one we had."

Upon hearing that, the product will suddenly jump in its attractiveness. Often the customer will ask if by any chance there happens to be stock somewhere in the back room, warehouse, or at another branch.

The salesperson can then state: "Well, that is possible and I had be willing to check. But do I understand that this is the model you want and if I can get it for you at this price, you will take it?"

A common variation of this influence tactic is the deadline, which are arbitrarily set by the seller. Some official time limit is placed on the customer's opportunity to buy. Many people make impulse purchases that they later regret, before the offer ends.

Other examples of scarcity tactics include:

- "You have to buy this photo of your children now because stocking limitations force us to burn unsold pictures within twenty-four hours."
- "I have so many other people to see that I can only visit you once. It is company policy that even if you want to buy this later on, I can not come back and sell it to you."

This phenomena also arises whenever something is banned or censored. That makes people want it more than they ever did. In fact, they might not have even bothered if it was not for the fact that their interest was aroused by the ban.

The best way to offset the scarcity weapon is to question what exactly do you want from the item. Whether you want it for its utility value, or just for the pride of ownership of a scarce item. If the reason is not for its utility value, that should immediately raise a red flag.

You can also use scarcity for your advantage. Suppose you are selling a used car. Place a well constructed ad in your local newspaper, and schedule everyone who asks to inspect the car to come see it at the same time on the same day.

When the first prospective buyer arrives, let them start looking at the car. They will start obsessing over its flaws in an effort to lower the price. When the second buyer turns up, you say to them: "Well, this other gentleman was here before you. So can I please ask you to wait for a few minutes. If he does not want it or can not make up his mind, I will show it to you."

All of a sudden, the first buyer will feel the pressure. Rather than accessing the car's pros and cons, he will be faced with a now-or-never decision. The first buyer would not be able to talk down your price because you have obviously more potential buyers lined up.

The presence of stacked-up competition will be too much for the first buyer to bear. He will either agree to the price and buy on the spot or leave abruptly. If he leaves, the same dynamics will come into play again on the second buyer.
