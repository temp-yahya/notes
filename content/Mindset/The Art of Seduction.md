The English word "seduce" is derived from the Latin word "seducer", which means "to lead astray". We all have an inner desire to be seduced, to be drawn out of our dull routines and into an erotic drama of imagination and possibility.

To be seduced is not necessarily to fall in love, but seduction can set the stage for a more traditional and lasting relationship. It is about building anticipation, mystery, and charm.

## Seductive Characters
There are nine types of seducers and they all have different dominant strategies:

- **Siren**: As a woman, you can portray the ultimate fantasy for a man; that is an uninhibited, promiscuous, pure symbol of pleasure.
- **Rake**: As a man, you can speak to the universal female need for desire, attention, and appreciation by showing her that you can do anything for her.
- **Ideal lover**: We all have broken dreams. The ideal lover represents the fantasy of those dreams without the disappointment we are used to from reality, life, and other people.
- **Dandy**: Most of us are trapped in societal roles. The dandy refuses to play them. By defying all expectations, the dandy shows what it means to be free.
- **Natural**: Our ideals are our childhood selves, when we were honest, spontaneous, and playful. Naturals remind us of who we once were, and that is why they are attractive.
- **Coquette**: Coquettes are masters of the bait-and-switch game. They raise our hopes, then shoot us down, again and again. Sadly, that only makes them more desirable.
- **Charmer**: We all like to feel comfortable. In a charmer's presence, we always are. They lift us up by highlighting our best traits, rather than focusing on presenting themselves.
- **Charismatic**: The charismatic has traits like confidence, purpose, contentment, and sexuality, that radiates out to attract us.
- **Star**: Most of us want to escape our lives. A star allows us to do just that by following them in their crazy, glamorous life that indulges our fantasies.

## Repulsive Characters
Some characters have anti-seductive behavior that makes them extremely unattractive:

- **Brutes**: They forget that romance is play. They skip the best part and come off as blunt.
- **Suffocators**: They drown you in affection before they even know you.
- **Moralizers**: They can not take a joke because all they want is for you to be like them.
- **Tightwads**: They are cheap. But seduction is about abundance and giving.
- **Bumblers**: They are so insecure that they have to drag everyone down to their level.
- **Windbags**: They do not pay attention because they are busy thinking about their response.
- **Reactors**: They are whiny. They kill the mood by complaining all the time.
- **Vulgarians**: They disregard attraction as deceptive. That is an instant turn off.
- **Greedy pigs**: They tend to want too much from everyone, which is exhausting.

## Stages of Seduction
The process of seduction includes four phases. It involves choosing the right victim, creating a false sense of security, sending mixed signals, and leading the target through various emotional experiences. The goal is to break down the targetâ€™s resistance systematically.
