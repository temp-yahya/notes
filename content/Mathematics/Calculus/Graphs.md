## Concavity
A real-valued function is called convex if the line segment between any two distinct points lies above the graph of the function between the two points. Similarly, a function is concave if the line segment lies below the graph of the function between the two points.
- If $f''(x) > 0$ for $x$ in $(a,b)$, then the function is convex for $a < x < b$.
- If $f''(x) < 0$ for $x$ in $(a,b)$, then the function is concave for $a < x < b$.

## Points of Inflection
A point of inflection on a curve $y = f(x)$ is a point at which the concavity changes. If the function $f$ has an inflection point at $a$ and $f''$ exists in an open interval containing $a$ and $f''$ is continuous at $a$, then $f''(a) = 0$.

## Asymptotes
An asymptote of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the lines approaches zero as one or both of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates tend to infinity.

The line $x = a$ is a vertical asymptote of the function $y = f(x)$ if:
$$
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \pm \infty \text{ or } \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \pm \infty
$$ The line $y = c$ is a horizontal asymptote of the function $y = f(x)$ if:
$$
\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = c \text{ or } \lim_{x \to +\infty} f(x) = c
$$
## Symmetry
A curve is said to be symmetric with respect to a line, called the axis of symmetry, if for any point $P$ on the curve, there is another point $Q$ such that $P$ and $Q$ are symmetric with respect to $l$; that is, $l$ is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting $P$ and $Q$.

Considering any one-to-one function $f$ and its inverse function $f^{-1}$, the graphs of $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are symmetric to each other with respect to the line $y = x$.

## Even and Odd Functions
A function $f$ is said to be even if, for any $x$ in its domain, $-x$ is also in its domain, and $f(-x) = f(x)$. Similarly, $f$ is said to be an odd function, if for any $x$ in its domain, $-x$ is also in its domain and $f(-x) = -f(x)$.
